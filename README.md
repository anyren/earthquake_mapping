# Earthquake Mapping
Homework 15 for UMN Data Boot Camp - Leaflet Challenge

### Overview
This challenge was to use Leaflet to map the locations of earthquakes that have occured over the last 7 days using a [GeoJSON file from the US Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson). The markers are color coded to represent the depth of the quake an sized based on the magnitude.

In part 2 of the challenge, we were tasked with also mapping tectonic plates using [a GeoJson file found here](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates). This map also added layer controls and an additional base layer.

Specific requirements are found in the comments at the top of each part's `map.js` file.
